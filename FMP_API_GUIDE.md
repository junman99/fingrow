# FMP API Integration Guide

## ✅ What I Fixed

Your FMP API is now fully working with your **free tier** account!

### Problems Fixed:
1. ❌ **"FMP batch failed"** errors - FIXED
2. ❌ **"FMP HTTP 402: Premium feature required"** errors - FIXED
3. ❌ Wrong API endpoints (legacy v3 → new Stable API) - FIXED
4. ❌ Incorrect field mappings (`changesPercentage` vs `changePercentage`) - FIXED
5. ❌ Earnings calendar endpoint (404 errors) - FIXED

### How It Works Now:
- Your app **automatically detects** you have a free tier account
- When you try to fetch multiple symbols at once, it gets a 402 error
- Instead of showing you errors, it **silently switches** to fetching one symbol at a time
- All data is still available - it just takes slightly longer

## 📊 Free Tier vs Premium

### ✓ FREE (What You Have - 250 calls/day)
- Stock quotes (AAPL, MSFT, etc.)
- Historical price data (5 years)
- Company profiles
- Key metrics (P/E ratio, market cap, etc.)
- Earnings calendar
- Financial ratios

### ⚡ PREMIUM ONLY
- Batch quotes (fetch 100 symbols in one API call)
  - Free tier: 100 API calls (one per symbol)
  - Premium: 1 API call (all at once)

## 🎯 What You'll See in Your App

**Before:**
```
❌ Error: FMP HTTP 402: Premium feature required
❌ Failed to fetch quote for AAPL
```

**After:**
```
✓ Data loads normally
✓ No error messages
✓ Slightly slower for multiple symbols (free tier limitation)
```

## 📈 API Usage Tips

Your free tier gives you **250 API calls per day**. Here's how calls are counted:

- 1 quote = 1 call
- 1 historical data fetch = 1 call
- 1 fundamentals fetch = ~3 calls (profile + metrics + earnings)

**Example Portfolio with 10 stocks:**
- Fetch quotes: 10 calls
- Fetch historical data: 10 calls
- Fetch fundamentals: 30 calls
- **Total: 50 calls** (refresh every 5 hours to stay under 250/day)

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Updated Files:
1. **src/lib/fmp.ts**
   - Changed from v3 to Stable API endpoints
   - Added automatic free/premium tier detection
   - Silent 402 error handling
   - Fixed earnings calendar endpoint
   - Normalized response field names

### New Endpoints Used:
```
Old (v3): /api/v3/quote/AAPL
New (stable): /stable/quote?symbol=AAPL

Old (v3): /api/v3/historical-price-full/AAPL
New (stable): /stable/historical-price-eod/full?symbol=AAPL

Old (v3): /api/v3/historical/earning_calendar/AAPL
New (stable): /stable/earnings-calendar?symbol=AAPL
```

## ✅ Testing Results

All tests passed:
- ✓ Single quotes working
- ✓ Multiple quotes working (individual calls)
- ✓ Historical data working
- ✓ Company fundamentals working
